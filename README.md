# MADICES-projects

A place for attendees of the MADICES 2024 workshop to hack on projects.

Please either fork this repository or use your own branches, adding your code to a subfolder of `src` following the other guidelines in the [Workshop Goal Statement](https://github.com/MADICES/MADICES-2024/discussions/6).

Projects can either be eventually parcelled out to their own separate repositories, or stored in a subfolder here.
